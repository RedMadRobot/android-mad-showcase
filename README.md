# Android MAD Showcase (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Showcase is a sample Android project that presents Modern Android Development (MAD) libraries and practices.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate modern tech-stack and take a fresh look at the development of Android applications.

# Environment

This repository uses Jetpack Compose. For the best experience developing with Jetpack Compose, you should download [the latest canary version of Android Studio Preview](https://developer.android.com/studio/preview) . Thatâ€™s because when you use Android Studio to develop your app with Jetpack Compose, you can benefit from smart editor features, such as New Project templates and the ability to immediately preview your Compose UI.

## Stack

* Kotlin
* Compose (WIP)
* Compose Navigation
* Coroutines/Flow (WIP)
* GraphQl/Appollo
* Jetpack ViewModel
